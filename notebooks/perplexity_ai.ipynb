    "\n",
    "If you’re like us, your curiosity was piqued by that mysterious, often pricey fluid that comes in a cute little bottle and is apparently not made of plates (we checked). What ceramic coating actually is is “a long-term nanoscopic exterior automotive paint treatment and protectant that is applied in a liquid form and cures to form a hard layer on top of the paint. Essentially, it's the candy shell that protects the paint's delicious chocolate center.”\n",
    "Everything You’ll Need To Ceramic Coat a Car\n",
    "Ceramic coating a car is an intermediate task that should take four hours to apply, but 24 hours to cure. There’s nothing worse than attempting to start a project without everything you need. Make sure you’ve at least got this stuff.\n",
    "\n",
    "Safety First\n",
    "Gloves to protect your hands, which will be closest to the product\n",

    "How to Ceramic Coat a Car, Step by Step\n",
    "1. Park the Car Somewhere Appropriate\n",
    "Make sure to work in a covered, well-ventilated, shaded space. Seriously, don’t breathe this stuff in, it’s not air and it smells bad.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Wash and Dry the Car\n",
    "Use the two-bucket method.\n",
    "3. Prep the Surface\n",
    "Surface preparation varies depending on how new/well you’ve taken care of your paint. This is arguably the most important step, as a ceramic coating on a poor finish will only seal in the imperfections. You simply are going to get the best results if you start with the best foundation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bare minimum, you’ll want to use a surface preparation solution to remove anything that will get in between the paint and the ceramic coating. A product such as Mother’s CMX Surface Prep is great for removing unwanted surface contaminants. If you wanna go all the way, you’ll want to take a machine polisher to the surface to get it all smooth and glossy.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the surface of the car is hot, let it cool to between 50 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit so you can apply the coating correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Apply the Ceramic Coat\n",
    "Read the instructions that came with your kit, as they can vary. Here’s a general guide:\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply the ceramic coating to the provided applicator as directed.\n",
    "Using the coated applicator, apply the product to the vehicle surface. Work in small areas, and apply in straight lines.\n",
    "Allow the product to sit as directed, usually 30 to 90 seconds.\n",
    "5. Wipe Off the Ceramic Coat\n",
    "With a fresh, clean microfiber towel, wipe off the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Let It Cure\n",
    "Once you’ve coated everything you want to coat, be sure to let the product cure for 24 hours. You don’t want anything—even water—to get on the car during this time. Plan ahead!\n",
    "\n",
    "Ceramic Coating FAQs\n",
    "Q: Can you mess up ceramic coating?\n",
    "A: Yes. You won’t mess up the paint, but ceramic coatings are much harder to remove than wax. Take your time with the application process and do it right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: What is ceramic coating made of?\n",
    "A: Everyone has their proprietary formulation, but the main ingredient is silica dioxide (SiO2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: How long does ceramic coating last?\n",
    "A: With proper prep, application, and a quality coating formula, a ceramic coating could last 2-5 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Can you wax over ceramic coating?\n",
    "A: Technically yes, but don’t. The short story is that the ceramic coating itself is much better at repelling water and other contaminants than the wax, which will sit on top of the coating. Just keep the car clean and use a ceramic booster spray product every so often.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Does ceramic coating need maintenance?\n",
    "A:  Everything needs maintenance! Keeping your car washed will help the coating perform at its best. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q: How long until you can wash your car after ceramic coating?\n",
    "A: The general consensus is that you should wait at least seven days before washing your car or driving in the rain, as the coating will still be curing after the initial 24-hour period.\n",
