    "Subvert the expectation of a typical playground joke.\n",
    "New Joke: \"Why did the kid cross the playground? To get away from the pedophile on the other slide!\" - This new joke takes the classic playground setup and turns it on its head by adding a dark and uncomfortable twist. The word \"pedophile\" is a trigger word that immediately makes the joke edgier and more provocative. It's not a joke for kids, and it's definitely not something you'd tell at a family gathering. But for those who appreciate dark humor, it's a joke that will make them laugh and squirm in their seats at the same time.\n",

    "Rating: 4/10 - This joke is somewhat vanilla, relying on a simple pun on \"pupil\" to create the humor. It's a classic play on words, but it's not particularly edgy or provocative.\n",
    "\n",
    "What would make it edgier: To make this joke edgier, we could add some darker or more uncomfortable elements to it. For example, we could imply that the kid is somehow violent or disturbed, or that the eye is not just a metaphorical object but a real, physical eye that the kid is throwing around. We could also add some unexpected twist or wordplay that subverts the listener's expectations.\n",

The idea of a kid gouging out their own eye is disturbing and uncomfortable, which makes the joke more edgy and provocative. The added phrase \"pupil-killer\" is a play on words that adds another layer of dark humor to the joke. Overall, this joke pushes the envelope of socially-acceptable humor and is more likely to make listeners squirm in their seats.\n",
